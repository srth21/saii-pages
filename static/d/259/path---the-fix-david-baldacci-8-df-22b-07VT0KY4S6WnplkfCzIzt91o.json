Why did he kill her? and Why infront of the FBI office?\nThe officer and his team go on the lookout for answers!</p>\n<h2>How is it?</h2>\n<p>Notice how many times I say words like “random”, “strange” in the summary. The books starts off with a completely obscure setup and a murder. There is no obvious reasoning as to why it happens. The first few chapters reveal nothing about it too. It seems to proceed like a quest with no answers. The detectives start looking at the murder from different perspectives and yet are unable to figure out the reasoning behind the happenings. For me personally, this created a very intriguing setup as every possibility you think of as a reason for the murder is slowly eliminated. I really liked how the book started and how the first 100 pages created a perfect base for the further chapters.</p>\n<p>As the story progressed, the answers were gradually revealed and the plot kept getting thicker. I loved the way the author made his characters deduce the answers. Like I said there were multiple questions in the initial setup. What I really liked was that the author took his time to reveal the answers and did not rush into revealing all of them at once. (Hence, the 600 odd pages rather than 300 to 400 which we normally see for thrillers.) </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Fix by David Baldacci!","date":"December 29, 2020","featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-fix-david-baldacci/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/welcome-to-the-blog/"},"excerpt":"\nHi.
