Hi. I am Sai. This blog accounts for all my readings and my take on them!

## Why did I create this?

Have you watched that Sherlock episode where he says that he has a mind map where he can go and look for any piece of information he has consumed before? I wanted my own mind map with the details of all the books I read and store like a library of the summaries of what I read and how I felt about them?

## About the type of books I read.

I am a big fan of Crime Novels and mainly Investigative thrillers. I pick up any book that I feel has an intriguing storyline. I am a big fan of Jeffrey Archer, Sidney Sheldon and James Patterson. I read some off beat less heard of books with similar plot as well. An example is the Reilly Steel series by Casey Hill. These are books based on Forensic Investigations and I really enjoyed them! 

Apart from this, I grew up reading(READ : Living in) Harry Potter. That series was the one that got me into reading in the first place. I just loved the mini universe it created for me. I often felt that I was living in that world.

I also read Self-Discovery and Self-Help books. I mainly read them to change some aspect of my life or to get a better perspective on something. I have to admit, these take some time and I do not finish them as fast I finish a Crime Thriller. I am also into Biographies and AutoBiographies. I just like character studies and learnings from their lives.
